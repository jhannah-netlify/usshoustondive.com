<b>September 5 2014</b> (Jakarta)
</p><p>
Car picks us up at 03:30, off the the airport, heading for home. Jerry and Jay
arrived in Japan, waiting for connecting flights.  </p><p>
Dive team out.
</p><p>


<b>September 4 2014</b> (Jakarta)
</p><p>
3am the fire sprinkler head in Alex and Jay's room decided the room needed some
moistening. Much like the dive boat we just left. Lunch with Leonard (Daniel's
son) and family. Spoke with the mobile phone shop about our Internet access
while in country. Dried and packed our gear.  </p><p>
Dinner with Capt. R. Mark Stacpoole (American Legation, US Naval Attach√©,
Jakarta, Indonesia), Col. Kirt Stallings, and MC1 Chris Perez. Discussed
Jerry's dive history on the Houston, the Dive Team's findings on this trip,
comparing notes with Chris' dives a month ago, and how we can protect what
remains of the USS Houston CA-30 through cooperation with Indonesian law
enforcement and the Indonesian Navy. Jerry gave the embassy copies of all the
DVDs he has compiled over the years, and a commemorative tile from this year's
dive. The embassy is excited about a return trip by the Dive Team (2016?), and
mentioned several upcoming dates in Jakarta in 2015: a commemorative dinner on
Feb 28 to honor the Houston, possible joint dive operations with the Indonesian
Navy again, and the local ANZAC Day events. The Dive Team is honored to be so
very welcome in Jakarta.  </p><p>


<b><a name="2014-09-03" style="color:currentColor">September 3 2014</a></b> (dive day 10)
</p><p>
Surface very calm! Oil leaking from the Houston bubbling up to the surface in
nearly perfect circles. Safety buoys floating high in the water (low currents).
</p><p>
Dive 1: Jerry and Alex dropped straight down from the safety line, hit bottom
at 101 feet. Moved aft noticing big sections of the deck opened with
cross-members showing. Pipes and wiring. Unable to determine if we were at or
past the starboard hangar. Came up before finding turret 3. Nice, long, deep
dive for Jerry and Alex. Jerry says his goodbyes to the Houston, in case this
is his last dive. On the ladder Jerry's knee gives out under the weight of his
double tanks rig.  </p><p>
Daniel and Jay did more shallow exploration near the primary safety line. In
the generally low visibility of the Houston Jay mostly enjoys the fish, but
today the visibility was good enough to explore missing hull plate sections.
Very good conditions. Jay lost his secondary weight belt on the way up, went
back down to retrieve it. Got the belt, but one weight lost, will look for it
on next dive. Jay retrieved the MBT dive sign off the Houston since our dives
are coming to an end.  </p><p>
Dive 2: Jay recovers his lost weight, placing it for later retrieval near the
primary safety line. Alex takes Jay on a tour of things he hadn't seen on his
previous dives: Porthole glass, bearings, and the starboard propeller shaft.
The propellers themselves were presumably salvaged just after the war, but the
shaft is still intact and impressive, even 70 years later. Returned to safety
line to find Daniel had already requisitioned Jay's weight for anchoring an
enormous fish he caught with his speargun. Said our final goodbyes to the ship,
and surfaced.  </p><p>
Dive Team packs up all our gear and personal effects. Light lunch while
motoring close to harbor. Smaller boat arrives, all gear and dive team
transferred onboard. Smaller boat heads back into dock, the same dock the local
Water Police use. Their intercept boats and undercover boats are all here.
Smaller boat unloaded into the truck and van while Alex exchanges dive team
shirt for local police training shirt. Team drives back to local Water Police
headquarters for more paperwork, and to exchange gear and information.  </p><p>
Daniel drives the team out to the headquarters of the district police general,
the top man in charge of all police (including Water Police) in the district
the Houston lies in. (Drs. M. Zulkarnain, M.M., M.H. Brigadir Jenderal Polisi.)
With Daniel translating, we showed the general historical pictures of the ship
and our footage of the salvage boat we found on the Houston 10 days ago. He
seemed to understand our concerns, and Daniel assures us that with these
connections his official report that he will be filing in 3 days when he
returns from Bali will receive the utmost attention at all levels of law
enforcement. He is confident that we can apply immediate pressure on the small
boat salvage operations, which should also help protect the HMAS Perth, who
lies nearby. And by offering a reward to any fishermen who report salvage
operations to the police which leads to arrests, hopefully salvage operations
will be kept off of the Houston and the Perth until we are able to return
(hopefully in 2016, <a href="http://igg.me/at/ca30dive2016">please donate</a>).
</p><p>
Arrived back at Daniel's shop to exchange gear between vehicles, and then back
to the Harris hotel. A&W root beer floats, burgers, fries in the attached
shopping mall were a welcome break from 10 days of fried fish.  </p><p>
Rinsed off all our gear in fresh water showers, hung it all up to dry, all over our rooms. 
</p>


<p>
<b>September 2 2014</b> (dive day 9)
</p><p>
Back over the USS Houston CA-30. Some surface chop, but very low currents!
</p><p>
Undercover police boat arrived, waved, did not board due to surface chop. Their
orange life vests can be seen from quite a distance.  </p><p>
Dive 1: Jay practices reel work on the safety line while Jerry and Alex dropped
down across midships to 80 feet. Drifting along the hull aft, looking for
torpedo 5 damage. Unable to locate due to poor visibility. Returned to hull,
crossing over to previous flag locations. Looked into large hole at this
location. Swam aft to where the major damage begins above turret 3. Dropped
down to 76'. Swimming against currents, checking out major holes in deck of the
Houston. Ascended to hull. Proceeded to safety line. Still had some air left,
so headed forward, ran 20-25 feet along plate line observing numerous sections
of hull plate missing. Looking into the ship saw several decks below. Turned
around at porthole glass, drifted back to safety line. Ascended.  </p><p>
Dive 2: Jay, Jerry, Alex dropped down the deck from the safety line, examined
several large holes. Swam to the bridge via the main mount leg. Bridge sitting
at 90 feet. Back up to the hull. Alex led Jay forward so he could see the first
fan. Headed back, surfaced. (Jay 7 minute safety stop since deeper than usual.
No headache.) </p><p>
Dive 3: Daniel and Jay do some shallow (60 foot) exploration. Lots of fish
today! Crabs and lion fish protect their small territories aggressively. 9 days
in, Jay is finally starting to feel oriented on the Houston. :) </p><p>
Back to the shelter of the island for the night.
</p><p>
Dive team out. 
</p>



<p>
<b>September 1 2014</b> (dive day 8)
</p><p>
Poor conditions over the USS Houston CA-30. Strong currents. All bouyes
submerged. Spent most of the morning attempting to place new safety lines,
recovering them.  </p><p>
Dive 1: Daniel reset 2 more safety lines, recovered previous attempts.
</p><p>
Dive 2:  Jerry and Alex swam to the bottom, found turret 2 upside down. Drifted
back to the top of the bridge. Recovered flags, took photos of tiles, surfaced.
Currents strong.  </p><p>
<a href="http://youtu.be/XjngNZTPr6g">14:00 Surface honors for David C. Flynn,
RM2C</a>. Backdrop is Jerry's large American flag which has been on all Dive
Team trips. Dive Team and crew in team shirts stand at attention as Jerry
announces honors and TAPS is played.  </p><p>
Dive 3: Jerry and Alex swam to the area nearest the radio room. They render
honors to Mr. Flynn and simultaneously released Mr. Flynn to rest with his
shipmates at 15:00. His commemorative tile was then released, to also rest with
the USS Houston CA-30.  </p><p>
Jerry and Alex also took photos with MBT plackard, tried to swim forward to one
of the torpedo holes in the hull, but the currents were too strong, attempt
aborted. Surfaced on safety line.  </p><p>
Currents strong all day. Further diving scratched. Returned to shelter near
fishing village. Daniel and captain organized scooter rental on the island
(Pulua Panjang). We toured the entire island. I (Jay) was wrong about my
previous journal entry stating that most of the island is covered by houses. I
reported what I was told, but now that I've been there I can report that most
of the island is only lightly developed, and the housing covers 10 to 20% of
the land mass. We rode to the easternmost edge of the island, where a modern
boat dock and shelter building are, and the northern tip of the island via dirt
scooter trails which is all "beach" consisting of a mound of coral and sea
shells 2-3 foot tall. Rode back to our dock and spent more time with the
children and villagers before the evening call to prayer signalled the
disappearance of most of the adults.  </p><p>
Small boat back to the big boat, swimming, and bed. All is well. Hoping for
calm seas for our last 2 days above the USS Houston.  </p><p>
Dive team out.
</p><p>





<p>
<b>August 31 2014</b> (dive day 7) 
</p><p>
Tech dive 1: Richard and Mike down the anchor line, but dive was abandoned
after brief exploration with a reel, due to low visibility and high currents.
</p><p>
Dive boat repositioned, which took nearly 2 hours. Jay checked the anchor line
position, reported that the line was rubbing an edge of a heavily
salvage-damaged section off the Houston, and that the line would probably saw
through. Good news: visibility good, not too much current down below.  </p><p>
Tech dive 2: Richard and Mike returned down the safety line, which was now
nearly severed already, laid cabe line and reel and proceeded forward to the
bow. Numerous artifacts found on the hull surface, located turret 2 on bottom
dislodged from the main super structure. Significant damage was seen to main
structural panels and numerous new openings were noted. Returned to the safety
line to find it severed, floated an SMB and ascended safely on that. Returned
to main vessel via tender boat.  </p><p>
Dive 1 (simultaneous to tech dive 2): Descended with new safety line to tie to
the wreck in the original midship area near the tiles. Proceeded across the
hull to the bottom of the ship, floating aft at 81 feet until we came to the
screw shafts. Swam under one of them, back down to the curve to head forward.
On the way saw the aft hatch, still intact, with multiple damage areas forward
of it. Arrived at turret 3. From the top of the turret to the existing metal
was only approximately 8 inches. Approximately 15 feet of the deck has been
removed from here. Continued forward. Found where they cut the poles to the aft
mast. Aft mast is missing. Continued 20 feet, then went up to the deck,
arriving on the flags. Tried to unfurl the flags, which had become tangled
overnight. Floated to tiles, crossed the hull to the other safety line,
ascended with safety stop.  </p><p>
Relocated the dive boat since the anchor line was now cut. Noted safety buoyees
from tech divers, sent small boat to retrieve them. Daniel arrives from shore.
Tech divers surface, pack up, and depart.  </p><p>
Dive 2: Daniel and Alex took new line to anchor, which was then raised. Went to
end of mast, saw gun directive (crow's nest). Looking into the bottom sand, saw
several pieces of debris. Returned to side of ship, forward to bow. All the way
back to the stern. Saw propeller shaft. Returned by the side of the ship,
looking for tiles in the hole we suspect they dropped. Returned to the safety
line, surfaced.  </p><p>
Dive boat sheltered for the night as usual, this time very close to the fishing
village. After more swimming, Jerry, Alex, Jay, the captain and crew took some
shore leave. Most of Pulau Panjang is covered by very small paving brick roads
wide enough for one car. The minimal traffic is composed of walking and
scooters. We walked past the island's power plant (solar, diesel), radio tower,
school, and mosque. Many other buildings are beautifully painted small homes
with very nice tile work and in very good repair. Captain told us that for
$4,000 USD we could buy a nice one and live there. Grocery shopping included
eggs, red sugar, water, and coconuts. Alex climbed one of the coconut trees,
and was flooded with marriage proposals from the local women, single and
married alike. :) </p><p>
Back on the boat. All is well.
</p><p>
Dive team out. 
</p>



<p>
<b>August 30 2014</b> (dive day 6)
</p><p>
Back on the USS Houston. 
</p><p>
Dive 1: Daniel and Alex plan to swim forward to the bow, down to the center
line of the deck, drinfting towards the stern to get more familiar with the
deck area. Checked out the forward gun mounts, 1 and 2. Continued drifting back
to where the bridge should be, to locate more of that area. Went out one of the
main masts to the crows nest, where you can still make out the forward looking
windows, even though it's been crushed to the point where it is hard to tell
what it is, only its location making it apparent. Followed the mast back to the
bridge area, continued aft until losing the ship. Ascended on temporary safety
line. Floated a diver marker to make it easier for the crew to locate divers
during safety stop. Returned on safety line.  </p><p>
Tech divers from Jakarta arrive: Richard Rigby and Mike Hortin. Tech dive 1
report: 30 meters max depth for 55 minutes. Swam forward down the deck until
arrived at salvage damage. Looked into some holes at various salvage points.
Noted major structural damage with large suspended steel sheets being loosely
held in place. Continued past the forward mast to the bow and returned to the
hangar section. Proceeded along the port side, noticed numerous small items
scattered along the port hull. Ascended safety line.  </p><p>
Dive 2: Jerry, Alex, Jay swam forward to the split in the ship. Then swam over
to the hull stabilizer, proceeding aft. Midship we crossed back over the hull
of the ship to the flags, then back to the safety line. Jay ascended while
Jerry and Alex swam aft to one of the propeller shafts. They decided to turn
around there as the amount of ship that has been removed makes it difficult to
navigate in that area.  </p><p>
Current has come up earlier than usual today, we've snapped another anchor
line. Motored back to shelter. Looking forward to an early start tomorrow.
</p><p>
Dive team out.
</p><p>


<b>August 29 2014</b> (dive day 5)
</p><p>
Motored to the HMAS Perth, anchored nearby.
</p><p>
Dive 1: Daniel and Alex took the Australian flag down. Currents were high so
set a reel for the currents. Quick scout of the ship. Hung the flag, took
pictures and video, and surfaced.  </p><p>
Dive 2: Jerry, Daniel, Alex, Jay dive the Perth. Down the safety line,
visibility is very good, slight current on the ship. Swam forward along the
starboard stabilizer until we reached impressive battle damage. Amazed how
large the holes left by torpedos are. Swam over the hull to the deck ending up
in the hangar bay area, most of which appears to have been removed by salvage
operations. Alex swam to the rear 6-inch guns, met back up with Jerry and Jay
at the safety line. Jay headed up while Alex and Jerry swum back to the 6-inch
guns, re-hung the Australian flag and took more video. Re-rolled the flag, swam
over to the starboard side prop shafts (near the safety line) to take a look
before resurfacing.  </p><p>
Dive 3: Back on the USS Houston, Daniel, Jerry, Alex, Jay were amazed how calm
the surface was (the best surface conditions we've seen so far this trip. Dove
down the anchor line to find poor visibility on the Houston. Trying to relocate
2 commemorative tiles that went missing overnight. No luck so far. Saw
beautiful large angel fish, and some bat fish. Jay is pleased to report no
headaches today. Apparently taking twice as much time resurfacing and the
safety stop works wonders for his sinuses. :) After Jay broke a rung off the
rusty ladder on the way up it, the surface was still so calm that Alex, Jay,
and crew went swimming / snorkeling above the Houston.  </p><p>
Dive 4: Jerry, Daniel, Alex dove down the safety line to explore more of the
rear of the ship. Jerry was experiencing mask problems, so the dive was fairly
short. Average visibility, currents were picking up towards the end of the
dive. Very little bottom time was left for the day since previous dives were
fairly deep.  </p><p>
All is well. Sheltered for the night.
</p><p>
Dive team out. 
</p>




<p>
<b>August 28 2014</b> (dive day 4) by the Dive Team
</p><p>
Dive 1: 3m visability. Jerry, Alex think they found the bridge area, which is
now piles of rubble, apparently from salvage operations.  Returned to safety
line. Jerry was having buoyency problems, so Alex quickly scouted the hangar
bay area directly below, returned to the safety line and both ascended.
</p><p>
Dive 2: 3m visability. Jerry, Alex, Jay dropped down the deck, trying to
confirm more information about the status of the hangar bay. At 70‚Äô depth, the
entire side of the ship is now a massive hole. The deck is missing. We could
see piping, conduits, structural support beams.  Jay experimented with a very
slow ascent rate up the anchor line to avoid his headaches. Jerry and Alex went
forward again, found the headsets again that were first seen on previous
dives.
</p><p>
Dive 3: Brighter, but same (3m) visability. Jerry, Alex swam forward to the
crack where the bow has been split off the ship since she sank in 1941. Headed
down to the bottom of the ship, surveying the bottom. Found a water intake vent
for the engines on the e bottom of the hull, approximately mid-ship. Proceeded
towards the deck, found massive hull plates removed in sections. Looking into
one hole found a huge grouper fish. Returned and relocated the commemorative
tiles to a better area closer to our current dive line. Proceeded to the
surface.  </p><p>
The wind picked up, strong currents ended our dive day earlier than we would
have liked. Sheltering against the island again tonight. Tommorow we dive the
HMAS Perth for the first time this trip.  </p><p>
Dive team out.
</p>




<p>
<b>August 27 2014</b> (dive day 3) by the Dive Team
</p><p>

Dive 1 
</p><p>
After spending the night in a semi-protected cove, we motored back to the
Houston to re-anchor at dawn. Daniel and Alex took the flags: the American flag
that Jerry has brought on every dive trip and the 60th anniversary, US Navy
flag, POW/MIA flag, and US Marine Corps flag. The flags were hung near where we
think is the hangar bay area. Set the anchor line.  </p><p>
Dive 2 
</p><p>
Reset the flags in a different orientation so they fly better. Set out and
photographed all the commemorative tiles. Placed the remains of David C. Flynn
RM2C and commemorative tile on the Houston‚Äôs hull. All the plaques will remain
until we depart the Houston.  We were informed that the head of Water Police
and possibly members of the press were going to meet with us. They arrived in
two modern marked police boats with their blue lights running. The seas were
too rough for them to board, so they circled a few times, waving and taking
photographs. Many uniformed personell were aboard the larger of the two boats,
presumably several high-ranking officers. We were standing the rails in our
Dive Team t-shirts. 
</p><p>
Dive 3 
</p><p>
Jerry, Daniel, Alex, Jay dove to explore more of the Houston‚Äôs foreward
sections. We took many more videos and photos that we look to sharing with all
of you. We discovered massive sections of the hull removed and we were able to
swim through a deck or two without anything overhead.  The winds came up,
cancelling further diving, we have retreated the safety near the island for the
night.

<p>
<b><a name="2014-08-26" style="color:currentColor">August 26 2014</a></b> by the Dive Team
</p><p>

Dear USS Houston CA-30 family and friends,
</p><p>

Greetings from the dive team in Sunda Strait, Indonesia! We'd like to give you
a short summary of the last two days on the dive boat.  </p><p>

Dive Day 1 
</p><p>

Stopped at the local Water Police headquarters and spoke to Colonel Hendri
about our ongoing concerns in protecting the Houston from salvage operations.
</p><p>
 
On our way to the dive boat, we came across a road block the local villagers
had put in place as a protest to make the government improve road conditions.
They were friendly, but were not going to let us by, so we had to backtrack
back to Merak and wait for the dive boat to come all the way around to pick us
up, which took most of the day. No diving. We motored past the Houston to
shelter for the night nearby.  </p><p>

Dive Day 2 
</p><p>

We arrived at the Houston at 7am to find salvagers on the Houston. Daniel
immediately used the loudspeaker to warn their crew that they are in violation
of local laws, that we are calling the Water Police, and that they will face
steep fines and jail time up to 2 years for any damage or removal of items from
the site. They hurried to bring their one submerged diver to the surface, and
immediately left the area. We have photos and videos of their ship and their
actions, which we have given to the Water Police. We also notified the US
Embassy.  </p><p>

The salvagers gone, Daniel set our dive rope and safety lines, and Jerry and
Alex dove to the aft area of the Houston. The destruction of the hull of the
ship by salvagers is shocking and heartbreaking. Large sections of the hull
have been cut and pried upward. Ammunition and metal are sitting on the hull,
piled for later removal by salvage divers. Jerry knows the Houston extremely
well, with 80+ dives on her since 2004. He knows how she's resting, and her
historical, and natural damage. Today was different. She has changed so much,
the navigation plan for the dive was unusable. Jerry was shocked that he barely
recognized her, the damage was so severe. Worse than he had feared.  </p><p>

We have 4 underwater cameras with us, will share our video when we're back home
with high speed Internet connections.  </p><p>

Jay joined Jerry and Alex for dive 2. We followed the anchor line down, but did
not find the Houston at 60, 80, or even 103 feet, where Alex found our anchor
resting on the bottom. Currents had shifted, and our dive boat was no longer
over the Houston. We re-surfaced, Daniel set a new line, we repositioned the
dive boat, and tried again.  </p><p>

Dive 3: Jerry, Alex, Jay drop down and now the Houston is right where we expect
to find her. We made contact just in front of the hanger bay. Our dive plan
shifted quickly, since the current was fairly strong. We swam into the current
heading forward, all video cameras running. Lion fish love the Houston. We saw
several, and quite a bit of other marine life. Unfortunately here too, damage
to the hull is extensive. The hull is being pried toward the surface. We found
commodes, some sort of square frame, more ammunition, a 50-cal shell, port hole
glass, and a sound powered headset similar to the ones Jerry's dad was wearing
on the bridge that fateful night.

</p><p>
After dive 3 the Water Police arrived and boarded us, carrying an impressive
assault rifle, in an undercover boat that can not be identified as Police from
a distance. Daniel spoke Indonesian with Officer Agus and the others. We gave
them copies of our photos and video of the salvage crew, which they transferred
to their mobile devices. They took photos of us, and with us, then disembarked. 

Jerry received an email from Captain Stacpoole of the US Embassy, asking him to
call them. He called and discussed today's salvage crew incident. Captain
Stacpoole informed Jerry that the US Embassy had earlier made contact with the
highest Water Police officials based on the email Jerry had sent the US
Embassy. That probably explains how the Water Police had arrived so quickly
(within an hour) of notification from the dive team earlier today.  </p><p>

Dive 4: Alex and Daniel drop down to the Houston to hang and let fly the
American flag that Jerry has flown on all of his dives as well as the US Navy,
POW and Marine Corps flags. But the currents are now too strong.  Dive aborted
after reaching the hull, but without leaving the anchor line. Visibility,
swimming conditions too poor. During the safety stop on the ascent the anchor
line snaps below them, the dive boat is now floating free. Alex and Daniel are
fine, but Alex says the snap was quite a shock, was glad the line snapped below
them not above.  </p><p>

End of dive day. All are well, excited for dive day 3 tomorrow. We will rest
well tonight.  </p><p>

All our best to all of you back in the States, or wherever you may find
yourself this beautiful evening.  </p><p>

<b>August 13 2014</b> email sent to Jerry Ranger:<br/>
Hi all.. I am Eddie.. In this mail i would provide info and report the current
issue regarding to the historical war asset of HMAS Houston and HMAS Perth
which lies beneath of Banten Bay, SUNDA STRAIT.<br/> i have attached 3 photos
of the wreck scavengers activity on HMAS Houston.. the photo was taken on 17th
july 2014 and the latest was 3rd Aug 2014... myself as an angler whom often
visit the site and always encountered with those wreck pirates.. I've heard
from the local boatman that earlier the pirates were captured by the local

<b>February 2014</b> by Jerry Ranger:
<p>
Back in Sept 2013, I received some news from divers in Jakarta that the HMAS
Perth and USS HOUSTON CA-30 were being hit by salvagers. I placed this email on
the USS HOUSTON CA-30 HISTORICAL SOCIETY where it started to grow to USS
HOUSTON CA-30 face book page, were Dana send it to Pattie Wright in Australia.
While Pattie started the movement in Australia to save the HMAS Perth, the
Houston Dive Team decided to get a dive trip up and go back to Jakarta in the
summer of 2014 to survey the USS HOUSTON CA-30 and HMAS Perth.  </p>
<p>
I started the process by requesting a permit from the Naval Historical Center/
Underwater Archaeology Branch in Washington D.C. in November. I followed up
with a phone call to the Office. To my surprise, the U.S.Navy was working on
the problem with the Australian government and the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. I
was requested by the Navy to send emails, photographs and videos from the
divers in Jakarta and the Houston dive team.  </p>
<p>
Naval Historical Center/ Underwater Archaeology Branch in Washington D.C.
stated the dive video you took may be very useful to determine if any damage
has transpired since you last dive there. Will keep you posted. The images and
communications you have sent have been very helpful.  </p>
